[[FIX_Execution_Report]]
=== *Execution Report <8>*

PowerTrade uses the https://www.onixs.biz/fix-dictionary/4.4/msgType_8_8.html[Execution Report <8>] message to:

* confirm the receipt of an order
// * confirm a stop order has triggered
* confirm the successful cancellation of an order
* relay fill information on orders
* reject orders

Each execution report contains two fields which are used to communicate both the current state of the order
as understood by the exchange OrdStatus <39> and the purpose of the message ExecType <150>.
